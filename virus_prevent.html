            <h3 id="dude_lol">Multiple times a day, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.<br><br>
                Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br><br>
                Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.<br><br>
                Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.<br><br>
                Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you have symptoms of acute respiratory illness.<br><br>
                Stay home from work or school until you are free of fever, signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours and without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications.<br><br>
                Seek medical attention if you have reason to believe you have been exposed to coronavirus or influenza. Call your healthcare provider before visiting a healthcare facility.<br><br></h3>
